🚗 FuelSight: Fuel Efficiency Prediction with AI

Predict your car’s fuel efficiency before you hit the road! This project uses Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to estimate miles per gallon (MPG) based on vehicle characteristics, helping drivers and manufacturers make smarter, eco-friendly decisions.

🔍 Project Highlights

Predict fuel efficiency using deep learning

Explore trends with interactive visualizations

Easily adaptable to new datasets and features

Optimized for accurate MPG predictions

📊 Dataset

The model learns from historical vehicle data with features like:

Cylinders

Engine displacement & horsepower

Weight & acceleration

Model year & origin

⚡ How It Works

Load & explore dataset – understand your vehicle data

Clean & normalize features – handle missing values and scale data

Train TensorFlow/Keras model – deep learning regression for MPG

Evaluate predictions – compare actual vs predicted MPG

🌟 Key Features

Accurate fuel efficiency predictions

Visualization of trends and anomalies

Easy-to-understand AI workflow

🚀 Future Enhancements

Deploy as a web app with Streamlit or Flask

Include additional features like fuel type or driving conditions

Experiment with different deep learning architectures

💡 Outcome

FuelSight helps you make smarter driving decisions and optimize fuel consumption, one prediction at a time.
